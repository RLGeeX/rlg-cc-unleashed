   - Historical velocity
   - Buffer for bugs/support

3. **Story Selection** (45 min)
   - Pull from refined backlog

   - Identify dependencies
   - Estimate if needed

4. **Task Breakdown** (30 min)
   - Break stories into tasks
   - Assign initial owners

### Format (15 minutes max)
Walk the board, not the people.

**For each story:**
- What's the status?
- Any blockers?
- What's next?

**Not a status report to manager**
- Team coordination meeting
- Identify hand-offs
- Surface impediments
- Quick problem-solving

### Impediment Tracking
```markdown
| ID  | Description | Owner | Status | Priority |
|-----|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| I-1 | API docs missing | SM | Open | High |
| I-2 | Test env down | DevOps | Blocked | Critical |
| I-3 | Unclear requirements | SM | Resolving | Medium |
```

## Sprint Review

### Agenda (1 hour)
1. **Sprint Goal Review** (5 min)
   - Did we achieve it?
   - What changed?

2. **Demo Completed Work** (35 min)
   - Show working software
   - Get stakeholder feedback
   - Discuss adjustments

3. **Metrics Review** (10 min)
   - Velocity
   - Completed vs. planned
   - Quality metrics

4. **Backlog Update** (10 min)
   - New items from feedback
   - Reprioritization needs

### Demo Tips
- Show actual working software, not slides
- Focus on user value, not technical details
- Have backup plan for demo failures
- Collect feedback in real-time

## Retrospective

### Format (1 hour)
Use different formats to keep fresh:

**Start/Stop/Continue:**
- Start: What should we begin doing?
- Stop: What should we quit?
- Continue: What's working well?

**Mad/Sad/Glad:**

| Set up pre-commit hooks | Dev1 | Next sprint | Open |
| Document API changes | Dev2 | This week | In Progress |
| Review estimation process | Team | Retro | Complete |
```

**Follow up next retro:**
- Review previous action items
- Celebrate completed improvements
- Close loop on unfinished items

## Backlog Refinement

### Agenda (1 hour, mid-sprint)
1. **Review upcoming stories** (30 min)
   - Clarify requirements
   - Break down large stories
   - Update acceptance criteria

2. **Estimation** (20 min)
   - Planning poker
   - Relative sizing
   - Identify unknowns

3. **Dependency Mapping** (10 min)
   - Technical dependencies
   - Team dependencies
   - External dependencies

### Definition of Ready
- [ ] User story format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Estimated
- [ ] No blockers
- [ ] Testable

## Metrics & Improvement

**Velocity Tracking:**
- Calculate per sprint
- Use rolling average (3 sprints)
- Adjust for team changes
- Don't game the numbers

**Quality Metrics:**
- Defect rate
- Escaped bugs
- Code review time
- Test coverage

**Flow Metrics:**
- Cycle time
- Lead time
- Work in progress
- Throughput

## Handling Common Issues

**Scope Creep:**
- Protect sprint commitment
- Add to backlog for next sprint
- Swap out equal-sized story if critical
