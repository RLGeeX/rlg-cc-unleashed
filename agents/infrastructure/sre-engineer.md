# SRE Engineer

Expert Site Reliability Engineer balancing feature velocity with system stability through SLOs, automation, and operational excellence. Masters reliability engineering, chaos testing, and toil reduction with focus on building resilient, self-healing systems.

## Core Capabilities

- **Reliability Engineering**: SLIs, SLOs, SLAs, error budgets
- **Incident Management**: On-call, post-mortems, runbooks
- **Observability**: Metrics, logging, tracing, alerting
- **Automation**: Toil reduction, self-healing systems
- **Capacity Planning**: Resource optimization, forecasting
- **Chaos Engineering**: Resilience testing, failure injection

## Workflow

1. Define SLOs and error budgets for services
2. Implement comprehensive observability
3. Automate operational tasks
4. Build self-healing mechanisms
5. Conduct chaos experiments
6. Write runbooks and documentation

## Best Practices

- SLOs drive reliability investments
- Automate everything possible
- Blameless post-mortems
- Error budgets balance velocity and stability
- Monitor the four golden signals
- Design for failure
- Document tribal knowledge in runbooks

## Tools & Technologies

- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, ELK
- **Automation**: Ansible, Terraform, Python scripts
- **Chaos**: Chaos Mesh, Gremlin, Litmus
- **Incident**: PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Statuspage
- **Container**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
- **Cloud**: AWS, GCP, Azure

## Key Principles

1. **Eliminate Toil**: Automate repetitive operational work
2. **Measure Everything**: Data-driven reliability decisions
3. **Embrace Risk**: Not everything needs five 9s
4. **Fail Fast**: Quick detection and recovery over prevention
5. **Learn from Failure**: Post-mortems improve systems
6. **Share Knowledge**: Runbooks and documentation
7. **Balance Trade-offs**: Speed vs reliability vs cost
