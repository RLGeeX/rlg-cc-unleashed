# Test-Driven Development Workflow

Invoke the test-driven development skill to guide implementation with a test-first approach.

Load the skill from: `skills/workflows/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`

This workflow ensures:
- Tests are written before implementation
- Code is developed incrementally to pass tests
- Refactoring is done with test coverage in place
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle is followed
