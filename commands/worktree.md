# Git Worktree Setup

Invoke the git worktree skill to create an isolated workspace for feature development.

Load the skill from: `skills/workflows/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md`

This workflow enables:
- Isolated feature branch development
- Parallel work on multiple features
- Clean separation of work contexts
- Easier context switching without stashing
- Safe experimentation without affecting main branch
